# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
# A project about deep learning.
# •	Developed a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs with an impressive accuracy rate of 90%.
# •	Utilized image data for training, including pre-processing and augmentation techniques, to improve model performance.
# •	Built and trained the CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras, optimizing for accuracy and efficiency.
